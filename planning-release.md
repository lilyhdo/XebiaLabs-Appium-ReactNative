# Planning a release on XebiaLabs

_With XebiaLabs's XL Release, you can plan, automate, and optimize your pipeline visually in a neat, step-by-step diagram which is referred to as a "release"._

Log in to XebiaLabs. In the top navigation bar, click on the tab 'Release'. Then click on the 'New Release' button.

You have now created your release. So far, it is a blank slate with only one phase. You can add more phases by clicking the 'Add Phase' button.

In a release, you can plan several phases for the release. Phases are typically general, high level steps in your release pipeline, such as building, testing, and deploying. This will allow you to manage, control, and optimize your process easily with this kind of categorical organization.

Each phase is comprised of many tasks which are more specific, such as testing, making sure prerequisites are fulfilled, running a script, or building. 

To add a new task, click on 'Add task' under the desired phase.

In the dropdown menu, you can specify the type of task. Tasks will execute specific steps in the release process. In this example, the task we add will run an automation script.
